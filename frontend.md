### FirefoxCP Isolated Web Context
It's Firefox's security and stability feature that implements process isolation for web content.

**Here's how it works**:
- Process Separation: Each website or tab runs in its own separate process called "FirefoxCP" (Firefox Content Process)
- Security Sandboxing: This creates isolated environments where malicious websites cannot access data from other tabs or crash the entire browser

**Resource Consumption**:
The process isolation can significantly impact your MacBook's performance.
